## Why Watch Anime Like a Normie?
Ever tried watching anime from the terminal? Yeah, me neither. But one day, while staring into the abyss of CLI tools and minimalism-induced existential dread, we thought: Why not?

Kaizen is here to fulfill that dream (or nightmare, depending on how much you love the terminal). A native, no-nonsense, super-aesthetic TUI for streaming your favorite anime—right from your beloved command line.

No more context-switching, no more bloated browser tabs screaming at your CPU like it owes them money. With Kaizen, it’s just you, your terminal, and an uninterrupted anime binge-fest.

Bubbletea for the framework, Go for the code, and vibes for the experience. Because why not make your terminal as cultured as you are?

So, grab your instant ramen, fire up Kaizen, and let’s go full weeb mode. Terminal supremacy, but make it anime.
